# Stagger

If a tween has multiple targets, you can easily add some delay between the start of each animation:

## Simple Configuration[​](https://shan82181.github.io/Noteshub/docs/GSAP/Stagger/#simple-configuration "Direct link to Simple Configuration")

```jsx
gsap.to('.box', {    
	y: 100,    
	stagger: 0.1 // 0.1 seconds between when each ".box" element starts animating
});
```

A value of **`stagger: 0.1`** would cause there to be 0.1 second between the start times of each tween. A negative value would do the same but backwards so that the last element begins first.

You can even stagger items that are laid out in a grid just by telling GSAP how many columns and rows your grid has.

All tweens recognize a  **stagger**  property which can be a number, an object, or a function:

## Advanced configuration[​](https://shan82181.github.io/Noteshub/docs/GSAP/Stagger/#advanced-configuration "Direct link to Advanced configuration")

```jsx
gsap.to('.box', {    
	y: 100,    
	stagger: {        
		// wrap advanced options in an object        
		each: 0.1,        
		from: 'center',        
		grid: 'auto',        
		ease: 'power2.inOut',        
		repeat: -1 // Repeats immediately, not waiting for the other staggered animations to finish    
}});
```

To get more control, wrap things in a configuration object which can have any of the following properties (in addition to most of the [special properties](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween#special-properties) that tweens have.
