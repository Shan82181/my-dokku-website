# Easing

this shows how animation will happened.

```jsx
  gsap.to(".green", { rotation: 360, duration: 2, ease: "none" });  gsap.to(".purple", { rotation: 360, duration: 2, ease: "bounce.out" });
```

## Ease types[​](https://gsap.com/resources/getting-started/Easing#ease-types "Direct link to Ease types")[​](https://shan82181.github.io/Noteshub/docs/GSAP/Easing/#ease-types "Direct link to ease-types")

For most eases you'll be able to specify a type. There are three types of ease: **`in`**, **`out`** and **`inOut`**. These control the momentum over the course of the ease.

:::tip
Ease **out** animations like **`"power1.out"`** are the best for UI transitions; they're fast to start which helps the UI feel responsive, and then they ease out towards the end giving a natural feeling of friction.
:::

```jsx
ease: "power1.in"// start slow and end faster, like a heavy object falling.
ease: "power1.out"// start fast and end slower, like a rolling ball slowly coming to a .
stopease: "power1.inOut"// start slow and end slow, like a car accelerating and decelerating.
```
